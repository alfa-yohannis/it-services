	\frametitle{Service Management Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Service management is not linear.
		\item Multiple aspects and components create a service.
		\item Both creation and consumption sides must collaborate.
		\item Components must align to create value.
		\item These components are organized into four dimensions.
		\item This chapter explores these dimensions.
		\item External factors also influence service delivery and consumption.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Four Dimensions of Service Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Balance is essential in service management.
		\item Services require all constituent components for growth.
		\item Four key dimensions identified:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Organization and people
			\item Information and technology
			\item Suppliers and partners
			\item Value streams and processes
		\end{itemize}
		\item These dimensions must work in unison.
		\item IT services operate in rapidly changing environments.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item IT services don't operate in a vacuum.
		\item Rapid changes in the environment affect services.
		\item External factors influence service management.
		\item Four dimensions apply to every IT service.

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Organization and People}
	\begin{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Organizations vary in size and structure.
		\item Structures are chosen based on the organization's needs.
		\item Current trend favors horizontal structures.
		\item Large organizations often require vertical structures.
		\item Agile organizations tend to have flat structures.
		\item Vertical structures are process-driven.
		\item Structure impacts service delivery effectiveness.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Culture in Organizations}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Culture is crucial for organization effectiveness.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Information and Technology in Service Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Information and technology are distinct but connected.
		\item Information refers to knowledge and data.
		\item Technology involves tools like servers, software, etc.
		\item Two main areas of focus:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item IT for actual services
