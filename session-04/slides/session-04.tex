	\frametitle{Introduction to ITIL 4}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ITIL focuses on creating value through services.
		\item In ITIL V3, all aspects of service management were viewed through the lens of value.
		\item ITIL 4 emphasizes value with an entire chapter dedicated to it.
		\item Value creation is centered on the Service Value System (SVS) and Service Value Chain (SVC).
		\item Guiding principles introduced in ITIL V3 are explored further.
		\item Importance of governance to ensure smooth operations.
		\item Examination tip: This chapter is crucial for ITIL certification.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Service Value System (SVS)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Value is co-created between service providers and customers.
		\item Services require collaboration between multiple organizations.
		\item Organizations need several components to work in harmony to create value.
		\item Example: A car's components must work together for it to function.
		\item SVS integrates various components into a unified system that delivers value.
		\item Two streams define the SVS: discrete components and organized processes.
		\item Exam tip: Expect a question on the service value system in the ITIL exam.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{ITIL Definition of SVS}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SVS describes how all components and activities work together as a system.
		\item Structure includes:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Opportunity and Demand as inputs
			\item Value as the output
			\item Service Value Chain at the center
			\item Governance and Practices surrounding it
			\item Guiding Principles and Continual Improvement
		\end{itemize}
		\item Organizations must integrate resources to create value.
		\item Organizational culture and flexibility influence value creation.
		\item Components of SVS are discussed in later chapters.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Opportunity and Demand}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Business is driven by opportunities.
		\item Products and services arise from identified opportunities.
		\item Example: Cell phone market growth led to new products.
		\item ITIL defines Opportunity as options to add value for stakeholders.
		\item Demand represents the need or desire for products and services.
		\item Both opportunity and demand are essential for value creation.
		\item Internal vs. External Customers:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item External customers bring real revenue.
			\item Internal customers are an organizational obligation.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Governance in SVS}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Governance provides direction to organizations and projects.
		\item It is integral to the SVS, processing opportunities and demands.
		\item Governance bodies ensure value creation aligns with organizational goals.
		\item Governance involves the definition and enforcement of policies.
		\item It has a high-level view of value-creating activities.
		\item Exam tip: Governance is not heavily tested on the ITIL Foundation exam.
		\item Governance also encompasses continual improvement.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Service Value Chain (SVC)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SVC is the core of the SVS, converting demands into value.
		\item Six activities are associated with SVC:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Plan
			\item Engage
			\item Improve
			\item Obtain/Build
			\item Design and Transition
			\item Deliver and Support
		\end{itemize}
		\item Activities are interconnected, not sequential.
		\item Value is generated through value streams, a series of activities.
		\item Value streams involve internal/external resources, ITIL practices.
		\item Example: Employee onboarding and provisioning a laptop.
		\item Exam tip: Understanding SVC activities is essential for the exam.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Plan Activity in SVC}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Plan activity involves identifying strategies and making plans.
		\item It ensures all parties share a common vision.
		\item Input includes customer demand, improvement opportunities, and governance policies.
		\item Outputs include strategic, tactical, and operational plans.
		\item Engage activity gets information about services/products and contracts.
		\item Plan activity also identifies improvement initiatives.
		\item The planning process is cyclical and continuous.
	\end{itemize}
