	\frametitle{Release Management Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Release management spans development and operations.
		\item ITIL defines a release as a version of a service or configuration item.
		\item Developed in lower environments and tested in higher environments.
		\item Testing can be manual or automated.
		\item Software moved to production as a release.
		\item Releases may include software, break-fixes, and hardware changes.
		\item Releases are often packaged to minimize production disruptions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Change Control vs. Release Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Change control: obtaining approvals and controlling changes.
		\item Release management: managing technical aspects of changes.
		\item Release management includes requirement gathering, coding, testing, deployment.
		\item Change control ensures development efforts aren't wasted.
		\item Change control also modifies solutions if needed.
		\item Release management handles overall planning and execution.
		\item Change control provides oversight before production changes.
	\end{itemize}

		\item Successful pilot further validates the chosen path.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Blue–Green Release Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item DevOps projects deploy without downtime
		\item Blue-green deployment runs two environments in parallel
		\item Environments designated as blue or green
		\item One environment is active, the other passive
		\item Active environment handles all user requests
		\item Passive environment deployed first
		\item Load balancer switches user requests to the updated environment
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Blue-green release approach} 	 \frametitle{Blue-green release approach} \begin{center} 	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/image-03.png} \end{center} \end{frame}

% Slide 2: Blue–Green Release Example
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Blue–Green Release Example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Example: Blue is active, green is passive
		\item Green environment deployed without affecting users
		\item Once green is ready, switch user requests from blue to green
		\item Blue environment is updated next
		\item Both environments receive updates requiring downtime
		\item Users experience no downtime
		\item Load balancer manages user requests between environments
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

% Slide 7: Deployment Approaches Overview
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Deployment Approaches Overview}

		\item Multiple deployment approaches based on context
		\item Big bang deployment: all users experience the change simultaneously
		\item Phased deployment: gradual release across regions or features
		\item Continuous delivery/deployment: automated deployment
		\item Pull deployment: users choose when to deploy updates
		\item Each approach has pros and cons
		\item Choice depends on the organization's needs and risks
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 8: Big Bang and Phased Deployment
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Big Bang and Phased Deployment}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Big bang: all users get updates at the same time
		\item Pilot deployment precedes big bang to ensure readiness
		\item High risk due to simultaneous update
		\item Phased deployment: updates rolled out over time
		\item Allows for learning and correction before full deployment
		\item Geographical or feature-based phased deployment
		\item Phased deployment mitigates risks and manages user impact
	\end{itemize}
