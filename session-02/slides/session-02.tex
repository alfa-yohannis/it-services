	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Outcomes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Value is co-created between the service provider and the customer.
		\item Value is highly subjective; perceptions vary between customers.
		\item Co-creating services tailors them to customer needs.
		\item ITIL Definition of Output: Tangible or intangible deliverable of an activity.
		\item ITIL Definition of Outcome: A result for a stakeholder enabled by one or more outputs.
		\item Customers judge based on outcomes, not just outputs.
		\item Objectives achieved through service are more important than outputs.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Outcome vs. Output}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Example: Netflix provides entertainment through on-demand videos.
		\item Outputs: Movies, TV shows, and documentaries.
		\item Outcomes: Customer entertainment, bonding with family.
		\item Outputs are tangible; outcomes are intangible.
		\item Outcomes depend on customer taste and perception.
		\item Services facilitate outcomes through one or more outputs.
		\item Metrics should focus on outcomes, not just outputs.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Costs in ITIL}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Costs pertain to financial transactions between consumer and provider.
		\item ITIL Definition of Costs: Money spent on an activity or resource.
		\item People costs are a significant part of service costs.
		\item Costs are calculated based on FTE (Full Time Effort).
		\item Direct costs: Imposed directly on the customer (e.g., service price).
		\item Indirect costs: Infrastructure, resources, etc., not directly charged.
		\item Service costs must be competitive and justified to consumers.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Risk Management in IT Services}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Risks are inherent in every business, including IT services.
		\item ITIL Definition of Risk: A possible event causing harm or loss.
		\item Risks can be borne by providers or consumers.
		\item Example: Uber reduces driving risks but may face connectivity issues.
		\item Service providers and consumers collaborate to manage risks.
		\item Requirements definition includes identifying and managing risks.
		\item Trust between provider and consumer is key in risk mitigation.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Risk Mitigation Strategies}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Risk Avoidance: Remove or negate the risk.
		\item Risk Transfer: Shift the risk to another party (e.g., insurance).
		\item Risk Mitigation: Counter the risk when it materializes.
		\item Risk Acceptance: Accept and prepare to deal with the risk.
		\item Example: Avoiding infrastructure uncertainties by canceling work from home.
		\item Example: Transferring car rental risks to an insurance company.
		\item Example: Mitigating server crashes with load balancing or failover mechanisms.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Utility and Warranty}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Value is created if a service is fit for purpose and fit for use.
		\item Fit for Purpose: Service meets all functional requirements.
		\item Fit for Use: Service is usable and capable of achieving outcomes.
		\item Utility of a Service: Functionality meeting a particular need.
		\item Performance Supported: Service must improve business outcomes.
		\item Constraints Removed: Service should eliminate barriers.
		\item Value creation requires both fit for purpose and fit for use.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Warranty of a Service}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ITIL Definition of Warranty: Assurance that a service meets agreed requirements.
		\item Four parts of Warranty:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Service availability
			\item Sufficient capacity
			\item Service continuity
			\item Service security
		\end{itemize}
		\item All four criteria must be met for a service to be fit for use.
		\item Value is created when both utility and warranty conditions are satisfied.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Criteria for a Service to be Fit for Use}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Table 3-3 provides the criteria for ensuring that the service is fit for use.
		\item It is not complete for all permutations and combinations.
		\item The AND gate provides a FALSE output whenever any of the inputs are FALSE.
		\item Available capacity and continuity are important factors.
		\item Security is also a critical factor.
		\item Without these, the service is not fit for use.
		\item Service assessments consider utility, warranty, and risks.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Examples of Criteria}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Available Enough? 
		\item Scenario: No mobile coverage in a resort despite claims of good service.
		\item Capacity Enough? 
		\item Scenario: Unable to make a call due to overloaded network.
		\item Continuous Enough? 
		\item Scenario: Frequent call drops during an important interview.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Summary of Criteria}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Service must be available, have sufficient capacity.
		\item Service must be continuous and secure.
		\item Any missing element devalues the service.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Service flourishes through cooperation.
		\item Value is co-created between provider and consumer.
		\item Trust is essential for a strong service relationship.
		\item Both entities must be transparent about needs and capabilities.
		\item ITIL defines service relationships as cooperation.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Service Relationship Model}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Services are often interdependent.
		\item A provider of one service can be a consumer of another.
		\item Many-to-many relationships are common.
		\item Example: Netflix uses Akamai, Akamai uses Microsoft Azure.
