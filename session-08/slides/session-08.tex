\frametitle{Service Life Cycle}

A service is conceived, designed, built, and supported throughout its life cycle. Key aspects include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Services are supported to ensure proper functioning.
	\item Break-fix is applied when issues occur.
	\item Smaller modifications are done ad hoc.
	\item Major changes undergo a continual improvement cycle.
	\item Activities visible to stakeholders highlight achievements.
	\item Enablers support service support practices.
	\item This chapter covers three support enabling practices.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Support Enabling Practices}

	\item IT Asset Management
	\item Service Configuration Management
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Information Security Management Overview}

Information Security Management is crucial due to increasing threats:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Introduced in design, not as an afterthought.
	\item Blurred lines with DevSecOps and Rugged DevOps.
	\item ITIL retains exclusivity in managing internal security.
	\item Collaboration with DevSecOps for external interfaces.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Information Security Management Practice}

The purpose is to protect the organization's information:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement security controls, policies, and processes.
	\item Activities include Detection, Correction, Prevention.
	\item Detection: Monitoring and identifying threats.
	\item Correction: Addressing detected threats.
	\item Prevention: Avoiding future threats.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Information Security Threats}

Key areas of information security threats include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidentiality: Unauthorized access protection.
	\item Integrity: Prevention of unauthorized modifications.
	\item Availability: Ensuring access to authorized parties.
	\item Authentication: Identifying and verifying entities.
	\item Nonrepudiation: Proof of actions and agreements.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Information Security Areas}

Expanding field of information security:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
	\item Added areas: Authentication, Nonrepudiation.
	\item Evolution from ITIL v3 to the current framework.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Information Security in Service Value Chain}

Information Security Management in SVC:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Plan: High involvement.
	\item Design and Transition: High involvement.
	\item Obtain/Build: High involvement.
	\item Engage: High involvement.
	\item Deliver and Support: High involvement.
	\item Improve: High involvement.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{IT Asset Management Overview}

IT Asset Management involves:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Planning and managing IT asset life cycles.
	\item Maximizing value and controlling costs.
	\item Managing risks and supporting decision-making.
	\item Meeting regulatory and contractual requirements.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{IT Asset Management Practice}

Purpose and importance of IT asset management:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tracking asset life cycles.
	\item Managing procurement, reuse, retirement, disposal.
	\item Reducing risks and controlling costs.
	\item Complying with standards and regulations.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Types of Asset Management}

Types of asset management include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hardware Asset Management
	\item Software Asset Management
	\item Client Asset Management
	\item Cloud-Based Asset Management
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Service Configuration Management}

Importance of Service Configuration Management:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Manages configurations and components.
	\item Essential for complex systems with multiple dependencies.
	\item Foundation for project success and service delivery.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{ITIL Definition of Service Configuration Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Purpose: Ensure accurate and reliable configuration information
		\item Includes CIs and their relationships
		\item Provides a blueprint of IT services and dependencies
		\item Enables ease of change, impact analysis, and outage resolution
		\item Keeps configuration data alive and accessible
		\item Avoids problems from lack of configuration management
		\item Essential for current fast-changing environments
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Slide 2
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Configuration Items (CI)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CI: Component managed to deliver an IT service
		\item Examples: Servers, routers, applications
		\item Can be individual components or whole systems
		\item Decision on CI level: Configuration architect
		\item Attributes: Owner, location, status, etc.
		\item Controlled through change management
		\item Ensures accuracy and prevents unauthorized changes
	\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

% Slide 5
\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Engagement in Service Value Chain}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Plan: Low involvement, but useful for change proposals
		\item Design and Transition: High involvement, supports design changes
		\item Obtain/Build: CIs created during this phase
		\item Engage: High involvement, identifies dependencies
