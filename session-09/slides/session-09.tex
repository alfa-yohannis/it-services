			\item “In this world, you are either growing or you are dying.”
			\item Growth applies to all aspects of life: work, entertainment, and services.
			\item No product or service remains unchanged and rules the market for decades.
			\item Status quo leads to obsolescence.
			\item Constant enhancements are necessary for survival.
			\item Examples: Mobile phones, Internet service providers.
			\item ITIL's approach to continual improvement ensures ongoing value.

			\item Improvements impact operational, tactical, and strategic levels.
			\item ITIL's continual improvement includes:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Seven-step model
				\item Improve activity in SVC
				\item General practice for continual improvement

		What is the importance of finding out where the organization is currently before embarking on identifying improvements?
		
		\begin{enumerate}[A.]
			\item A baseline serves as a starting point and as a comparison value for the progress made through improvements.
			\item Understanding where we are currently helps us understand the mistakes that were made earlier.
			\item It provides a balance in terms of the improvements that are taken before and after an improvement is delivered.
			\item The ground realities provide an excellent value to assess the relevance of improvement ideas.
