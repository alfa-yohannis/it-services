	\frametitle{Guiding Principles Overview}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Guiding principles are boundaries within which you can operate.
		\item They are recommendations, not rules or policies.
		\item ITIL's nonprescriptive nature is a key strength.
		\item The concept of guiding principles is new to ITIL.
		\item Introduced in 2016 with ITIL Practitioner certification.
		\item Initially, there were nine guiding principles.
		\item In ITIL 4, the principles have been revamped into seven.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{The Seven Guiding Principles of ITIL}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Focus on Value
		\item Start Where You Are
		\item Progress Iteratively with Feedback
		\item Collaborate and Promote Visibility
		\item Think and Work Holistically
		\item Keep it Simple and Practical
		\item Optimize and Automate
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Importance in ITIL Foundation Exam}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Guiding principles are crucial for the ITIL Foundation exam.
		\item You can expect five questions on guiding principles.
		\item These principles account for 12.5\% of the total exam questions.
		\item Questions test understanding and application of principles.
		\item Important to know the context of each guiding principle.
		\item The guiding principles are universal and practical.
		\item They are aligned with the Agile manifesto.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Application Across Industries}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Guiding principles apply to all industries, not just ITIL.
		\item They are common sense but need constant reinforcement.
		\item Similarities with Agile manifesto:
		\item Focus on Value aligns with Agile's "working software over documentation".
		\item Responding to change aligns with "Progress Iteratively with Feedback".
		\item Organizations may combine different methodologies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Combining Frameworks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Guiding principles allow integration of various frameworks.
		\item Agile methodology focuses on project flexibility.
		\item DevOps integrates development (Agile) and operations (ITIL).
		\item Prioritization conflicts can arise in integrated teams.
		\item Guiding principles provide direction in such conflicts.
		\item Example: Prioritizing tasks based on value creation.
		\item Frameworks like Prince, Lean, COBIT can align under common principles.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Implementation and Relevance}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Organizations should not selectively apply guiding principles.
		\item All seven guiding principles come as a set.
		\item Practical to use relevant principles based on context.
		\item Contextual application is crucial for effectiveness.
		\item Focus on Value is central to ITIL.
		\item It directs activities toward creating value for customers.
		\item Organizations must link services to value generation.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Focus on Value}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ITIL emphasizes creating value for the customer.
		\item Every service activity should link back to value creation.
		\item Example: Netflix gathers data to enhance customer value.
		\item Netflix uses customer data to fund and recommend new shows.
		\item Value creation benefits all stakeholders, not just customers.
		\item Value generation follows a four-step process:
		\item Understand the service consumer, their perspective, obtain feedback, and apply learnings.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Understanding the Service Consumer}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Understanding consumer needs is essential for value creation.
		\item Service providers must know their customers deeply.
		\item Example: A Mexican restaurant targets neighborhoods that prefer spicy food.
		\item Service providers should also understand other stakeholders.
		\item Knowing consumer perspectives translates to valuable insights.
		\item Providers should explore the reasons behind service use.
		\item Value is about perception, not just service quality.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Obtaining and Applying Feedback}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Feedback is crucial in the service industry.
		\item CX (Customer Experience) reflects customer feelings toward a service.
		\item Feedback helps adjust to changing customer perceptions.
		\item Surveys and interactions gauge customer satisfaction.
		\item Feedback should lead to actionable insights.
		\item Applying feedback is essential for continuous improvement.
		\item Service providers must co-create value with customers.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Start Where You Are}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Start with the current state rather than starting anew.
		\item Reuse existing foundations instead of laying new ones.
		\item Assess the current state objectively before making changes.
		\item Measurements are key to understanding the current situation.
		\item Measure outcomes, not just outputs.
		\item Avoid the trap of biased assessments.
		\item Use measurements to inform decisions about future actions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Applying the Principle of Start Where You Are}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Apply learnings from assessments to make informed decisions.
		\item Example: Modernizing a website with new features.
		\item Assess existing elements like CMS, server, and security.
		\item Identify what works and what doesn’t.
		\item Assess risks associated with current and new systems.
		\item Make decisions based on thorough analysis and risk assessment.
		\item Reuse what is functional; change what is necessary.
	\end{itemize}
