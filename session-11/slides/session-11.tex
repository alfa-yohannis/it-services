\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Importance of Change}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Operations maintain the status quo.
		\item Services or products need to evolve.
		\item Without changes, services/products become obsolete.
		\item Even simple products like confectionaries evolve.
		\item Example: Avatars of Haribo or chocolates change frequently.
		\item Exception: "Classic" Coke returned due to popular demand.
		\item IT products/services need constant improvement to survive.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Managing Change in IT}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Introducing changes requires careful planning.
		\item Principles, processes, practices, and procedures are essential.
		\item Users accustomed to a certain way of doing things may resist change.
		\item Change must minimize disruption to services.
		\item ITIL provides a framework for managing changes safely.
		\item Desire to change is high; appetite for risk is low.
		\item This chapter covers practices to manage change.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{ITIL Practices Covered}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Two key practices discussed:
		\item Service request management
		\item Change control
		\item Understanding these practices is crucial for IT careers.
		\item Change control is as important as incident management.
		\item ITIL Foundation exam heavily focuses on these topics.
		\item Expect 7-8 questions from this chapter in the exam.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Service Request Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Minor practice often confused with incident management.
		\item ITIL defines service request management.
		\item Purpose: Support agreed service quality.
		\item Handles predefined, user-initiated service requests.
		\item Ensures service requests are fulfilled based on agreed levels.
		\item Service requests must be well-defined.
		\item Understanding service requests is crucial.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Examples of Service Requests}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Requesting a new checkbook from a bank.
		\item Installing open-source software on a laptop.
		\item Requesting access to a portal.
		\item Asking for information, e.g., directions to a location.
		\item Providing compliments, complaints, or feedback.
		\item Service request is not a complaint or incident.
		\item Service request management was known as request fulfillment in ITIL V3.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Service Catalog and Incident Confusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Service requests must be predefined.
		\item Users can't request undefined services.
		\item All service requests are listed in the service catalog.
		\item Service catalog must be shared with users.
		\item Incidents and service requests were once treated the same.
		\item Incident: Loss of service; Service request: Getting something additional.
		\item Treating them the same increases service downtime.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Fulfillment of Service Requests}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Service requests are predefined and straightforward.
		\item Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used for fulfillment.
		\item Example service requests: Laptop request, software installation, experience letter.
		\item Each request follows a different flow and involves different teams.
		\item Portal used for initiating service requests.
		\item Automation can enhance the efficiency of request fulfillment.
		\item Service requests are a form of standard changes.
	\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Guidelines for Service Request Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Clear boundaries for service requests, incidents, and changes.
		\item All service requests must be clearly defined.
		\item Service catalog should be available to all users.
		\item Standardize service request flows where possible.
		\item Automate service requests that don't need human intervention.
		\item Service request management should be continuously improved.
		\item Engage with the Service Value Chain (SVC) for better service.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Change Control Practice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Change is constant and necessary in IT.
		\item Changes must be managed to avoid negative impacts.
		\item Mismanagement of changes can cause incidents.
		\item ITIL defines change as affecting service components.
		\item Components include servers, software, networks, etc.
		\item Managing changes requires careful consideration.
		\item Change control ensures changes are handled properly.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Examples of Changes}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Implementation of fiber optic Internet service

	\frametitle{ITIL Definition of Change Control Practice}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Maximize successful service and product changes
		\item Ensure risks are assessed

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Scope of Change Control}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ITIL does not specify scope boundaries
		\item Scope depends on service provider and customer
		\item Multiple elements managed by IT professionals
		\item Financial considerations impact scope
		\item Standard changes and service requests for peripheral objects
	\end{itemize}
